        <p><strong>Step 1)</strong> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2)</strong> Combine sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, garlic, ginger, and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer, stirring frequently, until teriyaki sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3)</strong> Place chicken thighs in the prepared baking dish. Brush both sides of each thigh with the sauce. Reserve any extra sauce for basting.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4)</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5)</strong> Flip chicken and brush with sauce. Continue to bake, basting with remaining sauce every 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear, 20 to 30 more minutes.</p>
